	<LongDescription>
Disable all talking on the in-game radio.

Tired of yet again hearing a German-ish professor expound on the housing market? Or of hearing Thomas Hornbuckle enjoy the sound of his own voice?
Me too, that's why I made this mod!
With this mod, all the commercials, PSA's like overbudgeted services and housing shortages, news updates like traffic jams, and weather warnings are removed, leaving only the music.
There's a toggle in the Options menu for this mod to enable weather warnings, in case you want to be alerted about hail or tornados.
With this mod, the 'Ads' toggle in the Radio menu and the options doesn't do anything anymore.

The mod icon is made from the in-game icons AdvisorRadio, Communication, and the red circle from NoMoney.
